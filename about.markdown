## 💻

My name is Michael Künneke. I'm a software developer and IT consultant living in Germany. Computers and software have been a part of my life for half of it. What started as an interest in one of many school subjects has become my job but also my hobby.

## 👨‍👩‍👦 🇸🇬 🇵🇭

When I'm not occupied dealing with computers, I like to spend time with my wife and my son. As often as time allows we travel around . Our favourite destinations are Singapore , the city of the future, and especially the Philippines with its astonishing nature and welcoming people. And of course because half of our family holds the filipino passport.
